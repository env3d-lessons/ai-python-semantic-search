# AI Models and Semantic Search

## 1. AI Models are Like Functions
- You give them an input, and they give you a prediction.
- The output is usually a guess about the input, often in the form of scores for different possibilities.

## 2. Hugging Face Models
- Hugging Face provides a large collection of pre-trained AI models.
- Python libraries make it easy to use these models for different tasks.

## 3. Common Uses
- Detecting the emotion in a sentence (sentiment analysis)
- Recognizing objects in images (image classification)
- Generating captions for pictures (image captioning)

## 4. Embeddings
- Embeddings turn text or images into a list of numbers.
- The numbers themselves don’t mean much by themselves.
- Comparing two sets of numbers shows how similar they are.  
  - The closer the numbers, the closer the meaning of the text or image.

## 5. Semantic Search
- We can use embeddings to build a search system.
- The system finds items not just by matching words, but by matching meaning.

# Demo

To run the demo, first install the following python packages

```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install pyarrow fastparquet
pip install sentence_transformers faiss-cpu
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

The `images/` directory contains some sample images from imagenet.  If you like, you 
can run:

```
python download_images.py
``` 

to download some new images from imagenet.  If you do refresh the images, you need to delete
the `faiss_index.bin` file so the search function will re-create it:

```
rm faiss_index.bin
```

Finally run 

```
python search.py
```

for the command-line search engine.

# Exercises

  - Drop your own images into the images folder and test to see if semantic search still works (you will need to remove the current faiss_index.bin and re-create)

  - Experiment with different search phrase and note all the interesting observations.

  - Use github co-pilot to help complete `app.py` and `index.html` to achieve the following:

    - Complete the search functionality in `app.py` such that the following call 
      ```shell
      curl localhost:8000/search?query=...
      ```
      will call semantic_search.search() and return a list of image file names.

    - Create a simple front-end in index.html so that user can type in a text description and be shown the related images in the `images/` directory

    - You can run `app.py` as a webapp using the following command:
      ```
      uvicorn app:app --reload
      ```
